Slicing is used to get multiple characters (a substring) from a string.
Its syntax is similar to that of indexing, but instead of just one index you use two indices (numbers)
separated by a colon, e.g. <code>str[ind1:ind2]</code>.

<h5>Example</h5>
<pre><code>
str[start:end] # items start through end-1
str[start:]    # items start through the rest of the array
str[:end]      # items from the beginning through end-1
str[:]         # a copy of the whole array
</code></pre>

Use slicing to get <code>"Python"</code> from the <code>monty_python</code> variable.
